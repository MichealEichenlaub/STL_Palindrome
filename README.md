# STL_Palindrome
<pre>
- A Quick solution to the palindrome problem. This uses the STL stack and queue to read a string and test to see if it is a palindrome
- This implentation does not take in user inputs, but could be modified to do so. 

- This program functions by removing the top value of the stack and the first value of the queue and comparing them.
  in the case that it is a palindrome , the result will be true, in the case that it is not it will be false.
  
- This works because the stack is a LIFO data stucture where as the queue is a FIFO data stucture. A stack can be thought of 
  as reading the word backwards and the queue can be thought of as reading the word forwards.
